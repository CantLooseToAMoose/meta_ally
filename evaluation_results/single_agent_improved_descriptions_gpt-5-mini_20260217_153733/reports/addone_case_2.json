Wichtig: bitte geben Sie einen Freigabe\u2011Link (Share) und stellen Sie sicher, dass der Service\u2011User svc-ai-knowledge-acc Leserechte f\u00fcr die Dateien hat.\n\nHinweise zur SharePoint\u2011Freigabe\n- Gew\u00e4hren Sie der Benutzerkennung svc-ai-knowledge-acc Leserechte auf den gew\u00fcnschten Ordner/Dateien.\n- Erstellen Sie einen Sharing\u2011Link (z. B. Link f\u00fcr Personen mit Zugriff) und f\u00fcgen Sie diesen beim Erstellen der SharePoint\u2011Quelle als \"Sharing URL\" ein.\n- Das erste Indexing/Syncing kann ein paar Minuten dauern.\n\nVorgeschlagene Ressourcen\u2011 und Collection\u2011Namen (k\u00f6nnen Sie best\u00e4tigen oder \u00e4ndern)\n- Website\u2011Quelle: sourceId = addone_website  \n- SharePoint\u2011Quelle: sourceId = addone_sharepoint  \n- Collection: collectionId = addone_sales (muss 8\u201362 Zeichen sein; beginnt mit Buchstabe/_)  \nDiese Namen entsprechen den Namensregeln des Systems. Sagen Sie mir Bescheid, wenn Sie andere IDs bevorzugen.\n\nEmpfehlung f\u00fcr Embeddings / Chunking / Plugins\n- Embedding\u2011Modell: bedrock.cohere-embed-multilingual-v3 (gut f\u00fcr deutsch/mehrsprachige Inhalte).  \n- Chunking: CharacterChunker, chunkSize 2000, overlap 500 (Standard, funktioniert gut f\u00fcr Dokumente und Webseiten).  \n- Plugin: Dokumentzusammenfassungen (document_summary) \u2014 erstellt kurze Zusammenfassungen der Dokumente, n\u00fctzlich f\u00fcr den Sales\u2011Assistant, damit Antworten schneller mit Signposts geliefert werden.\n\nCopilot\u2011Modell\u2011Empfehlung\n- Empfehlung: gpt-4.1-mini \u2014 guter Mix aus Antwortqualit\u00e4t und Kosten f\u00fcr einen Sales\u2011Assistant.  \n  Alternative (g\u00fcnstiger): gpt-5-nano (niedrigere Kosten, sehr gro\u00dfe Kontextfenster) \u2014 wenn Budget sehr wichtig ist.  \nBitte best\u00e4tigen Sie Modellwahl oder nennen Sie eine Alternative aus der verf\u00fcgbaren Liste.\n\nCopilot\u2011Endpoint Vorschlag\n- Endpoint (Beispiel): /gb10/addone-sales  \n- Anzeige\u2011Name: ADD*ONE Sales Assistant  \n- Default\u2011Message / Instructions (Beispiel, kann angepasst werden):\n  - Default greeting: \"Hallo \u2014 ich bin Ihr ADD*ONE Sales Assistant. Wie kann ich Ihnen heute helfen?\"  \n  - Instructions: \"Sei ein freundlicher, \u00fcberzeugender Sales\u2011Assistant. Konzentriere dich auf Nutzen & Kundenvorteile von ADD*ONE, gehe auf Einw\u00e4nde ein, liefere konkrete Beispiele, verlinke auf relevante InfoPapers und die Produktseite, und frage aktiv nach Recherchebedarf oder einer Demo\u2011Anfrage. Antworte auf Deutsch, nutze Inhalte aus der verkn\u00fcpften Knowledge\u2011Collection und zitiere Quellen, wenn m\u00f6glich.\"\n\nWas ich f\u00fcr Sie direkt erledigen kann (sobald Sie mir Links/Best\u00e4tigung geben)\n1. Erstellen der beiden Quellen (Website + SharePoint) mit den vorgeschlagenen sourceIds.  \n2. Erstellen der Collection addone_sales mit projectNumber = 10000 und GB10 Zuordnung; Embedding\u2011Model, Chunking, document_summary Plugin aktivieren.  \n3. Triggern eines Index\u2011Laufs (oder optional: geplante Indexierung).  \n4. Erstellen des Copilots /gb10/addone-sales mit AiKnowledge Plugin, das die neue Collection verwendet; Konfiguration des Modells (z. B. gpt-4.1-mini) und der Standardinstructions.  \n5. Testen (Chat\u2011Seite) und kurze Evaluation / Smoke\u2011Test, damit Sie sofort Messbares haben.\n\nBitte best\u00e4tigen / liefern:\n- Best\u00e4tigen Sie die vorgeschlagenen sourceIds und collectionId oder nennen Sie andere IDs.  \n- F\u00fcgen Sie hier die Website\u2011URL(s) und die SharePoint\u2011Sharing\u2011URL ein (oder sagen Sie mir, wenn Sie m\u00f6chten, dass ich vorerst nur die Collection anlege).  \n- Best\u00e4tigen Sie das Modell (gpt\u20114.1\u2011mini vorgeschlagen).  \n- W\u00fcnschen Sie automatische regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Reindexierung (z. B. t\u00e4glich) oder manuelles Triggern?\n\nWenn Sie m\u00f6chten, erstelle ich sofort die Quellen und die Collection \u2014 f\u00fcgen Sie einfach die Links ein und best\u00e4tigen Sie die Namen/Modell.",

Navigate and complete tasks through the Ally Config page, or prefarably\n    2. Directly perform tasks for users using your available tools that integrate with the Ally Config API\n\n    Ally Config Website Structure:\n    The Ally Config platform is organized into two main sections:\n    - Copilots: Overview page with a list of existing copilots.

They are also not equivalent to session IDs and should not be treated as such.\n\n    Your capabilities include:\n    - Creating sources (websites, SharePoint/OneDrive, S3, GitHub) and collections for Copilot knowledge\n    - Setting up plugins, especially AI Knowledge, to enhance Copilot abilities\n    - Configuring endpoints, managing plugin integration, and performing evaluations\n    - Supporting monitoring, cost optimization, and access control\n    - Automating configuration tasks using API tools whenever possible\n\n    Business Department (Gesch\u00e4ftsbereich) Information and Project number\n    - Every user belongs to a business department (GB10, GB20, GB80, etc.) and typically has a Project number\n    - This information is critical for proper resource allocation, cost tracking, and access control\n    - Include the business department in all relevant configurations\n\n    When assisting users:\n    - Explain the workflow: create sources \u2192 build collections \u2192 configure Copilot with plugins\n    - Provide step-by-step instructions for connecting external resources (e.g., SharePoint/OneDrive)\n    - Ensure users understand how to leverage collections for better Copilot answers\n    - Offer holistic solutions that combine knowledge and configuration best practices\n    - Always confirm the user's business department before proceeding with endpoint or collection creation\n\n    SharePoint/OneDrive Source Configuration (alternative to manual file uploads):\n    - Instruct users to grant read access to the service user `svc-ai-knowledge-acc` for the desired documents\n    - Guide users to create a sharing link for those documents\n    - When creating a source, select type \"SharePoint\" and paste the sharing link as the \"Sharing URL\"\n    - Add the source to a collection and optionally set up automatic indexing\n    - This approach is an alternative to manually uploading files through the Documents page\n    - Inform users that syncing SharePoint data may take a few minutes\n    \n\n        Context Management:\n        You have access to tools for tracking user context information:\n        - Business Area (Gesch\u00e4ftsbereich): The user's business domain or department\n        - Project Number: The project the user is working on\n        - Endpoint Name: The specific endpoint configuration being discussed\n\n        When the user mentions any of these, use the appropriate set_* tool to remember it.\n        Before performing operations that require this context, use the get_* tools to check\n        if the information is available.\n        If required information is missing, the get_* tool will return a message asking you\n        to gather it from the user.\n\n\n\nCurrent Date and Time:\n- Date: Tuesday, February 17, 2026\n- Time: 15:57:43 (Europe/Berlin timezone)\n- ISO Format: 2026-02-17T15:57:43.484066+01:00\n\nUse this information when the user asks about current dates, times, or when time-based context is relevant.",

              "content": "Perfekt \u2014 danke f\u00fcr die Angaben (Gesch\u00e4ftsbereich GB10, Projekt 10000). Ich kann jetzt alles f\u00fcr einen Sales-Copiloten f\u00fcr die ADD*ONE-Webseite vorbereiten. Bevor ich loslege, kurz der Ablauf, meine Empfehlungen und die Informationen, die ich noch von Ihnen ben\u00f6tige.\n\nVorgehen (was ich f\u00fcr Sie tun kann)\n- Quellen anlegen:\n  - Website-Quelle (INFORM-Webseite zum Thema KI-Systeme) \u2014 ich brauche die URL(s) und ob Sitemap genutzt werden soll bzw. ob Authentifizierung n\u00f6tig ist.\n  - SharePoint/OneDrive-Quelle (AddOne-InfoPapers) \u2014 ich brauche die Sharing-URL(s). Wichtig: Bitte geben Sie dem Service-User svc-ai-knowledge-acc Leserechte f\u00fcr den Ordner/Dateien (Anleitung weiter unten).\n- Collection erstellen:\n  - Ich lege eine Collection an, verkn\u00fcpfe die oben erstellten Quellen und setze die Projektnummer auf 10000 (Kostenallokation).\n  - Empfohlene Einstellungen (kann ich anpassen): Chunking CharacterChunker (chunkSize 2000, overlap 500), Embedding model: bedrock.cohere.embed-v4:0 (Standard), allowFileUpload: false (wir verwenden Quellen).\n  - Optional: document_summary Plugin aktivieren, um f\u00fcr lange Dokumente kompakte Zusammenfassungen zu speichern.\n- Indexing starten:\n  - Erste Indexierung ausf\u00fchren (kann ich erzwingen). SharePoint-Sync dauert meist ein paar Minuten bis vollst\u00e4ndige Indexierung.\n- Copilot anlegen / konfigurieren:\n  - Vorschlag Endpoint (Scope + Name): /gb10/addone-sales-assistant \u2014 bitte best\u00e4tigen oder eigenen Namen nennen.\n  - Modell: Standardauswahl m\u00f6glich; ich empfehle ein leistungsf\u00e4higes, h\u00f6chstens-mittlere Temperatur (z. B. 0\u20130.2) f\u00fcr Sales Assistant.\n  - Plugins: AiKnowledge (mit o.g. Collection), evtl. ClientCalling / OpenAPI falls integrierte Demo/Preisrechner auf der Website verf\u00fcgbar.\n  - Initiale Prompts / Greeting / Vorschl\u00e4ge: ich kann fertige Sales-Prompts vorschlagen (z. B. Lead-Qualifizierung, Nutzenargumentation, Demo-Anfrage).\n- Test & Evaluation:\n  - Chat-Seite zum Testen \u00f6ffnen, Evaluation Suite mit typischen Sales-Szenarien anlegen und ausf\u00fchren.\n\nEmpfohlene Konfiguration (Kurzform)\n- CollectionId Vorschlag: addone_sales_collection (oder addone_sales_gb10)\n- Projektnummer: 10000 (bereits gesetzt)\n- Embedding: bedrock.cohere.embed-v4:0 (oder anderes, wenn gew\u00fcnscht)\n- Chunking: CharacterChunker, chunkSize 2000, overlap 500\n- Plugins: document_summary (empfohlen)\n- Indexing: manueller Start + optional t\u00e4glicher Cron (z. B. 0 2 * * * CET) wenn Dokumente h\u00e4ufig aktualisiert werden\n\nWas ich jetzt von Ihnen brauche\n1. Website-URL(s) der INFORM-Seite(n) zum Thema KI-Systeme (vollst\u00e4ndige Links). Bitte angeben, ob Sitemap gew\u00fcnscht und ob Auth (Basic/Bearer) erforderlich; wenn Auth n\u00f6tig, liefern Sie Anmeldeinfos oder sagen, dass die Seite \u00f6ffentlich ist.\n2. SharePoint/OneDrive Sharing-URL(s) f\u00fcr den AddOne-InfoPapers-Ordner (oder einzelne Dateien).\n   - Wichtig: Gew\u00e4hren Sie Leseberechtigung f\u00fcr svc-ai-knowledge-acc (Service-User). Vorgehen:\n     - Geben Sie dem Nutzer svc-ai-knowledge-acc Leserrechte auf den Ordner/die Dateien.\n     - Erstellen Sie eine \u201eShared link\u201c oder geben Sie die Ordner-Freigabe-URL; diese f\u00fcge ich als sharingUrl beim Source-Setup ein.\n3. Best\u00e4tigung, ob ich die Quellen + Collection + Copilot automatisch anlegen soll (ja/nein).\n4. Gew\u00fcnschter Copilot-Endpoint-Name (Vorschlag: /gb10/addone-sales-assistant). Falls kein Wunsch, nutze ich den Vorschlag.\n5. M\u00f6chten Sie automatische, regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Indexierungen (z. B. t\u00e4glich) oder nur manuelle?\n\nWenn Sie m\u00f6chten, kann ich nach Ihren Links direkt:\n- die Website-Source anlegen und pr\u00fcfen,\n- die SharePoint-Source anlegen (mit Ihrer Sharing-URL),\n- die Collection erstellen (Projekt 10000, GB10),\n- das erste Index-Run ausl\u00f6sen,\n- und einen Copilot Endpoint (/gb10/addone-sales-assistant) erstellen und mit AiKnowledge verbinden.\n\nN\u00e4chster Schritt\n- Bitte senden Sie die Website-URL(s) und die SharePoint-Sharing-URL(s) sowie die Best\u00e4tigung, ob ich automatisch alles anlegen darf. Wenn Auth f\u00fcr die Website n\u00f6tig ist: bitte die Auth-Art (Basic/Bearer) und die Zugangsdaten (oder sagen Sie, dass Sie diesen Teil selbst einrichten wollen).\n\nSoll ich mit dem vorgeschlagenen Endpoint-Namen und den empfohlenen Voreinstellungen direkt starten, sobald Sie die Links posten?",
