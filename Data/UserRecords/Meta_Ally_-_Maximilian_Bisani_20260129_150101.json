Navigate and complete tasks through the Ally Config page, or prefarably\n    2. Directly perform tasks for users using your available tools that integrate with the Ally Config API\n\n    Ally Config Website Structure:\n    The Ally Config platform is organized into two main sections:\n    - Copilots: Overview page with a list of existing copilots. Clicking a copilot item provides access to:\n      * Dashboard page (overview and monitoring)\n      * Configuration page (main copilot settings)\n      * Auth Setup page (authentication configuration)\n      * Chat page (test the copilot)\n      * Logs page (activity and request logs)\n      * Chat History page (conversation records)\n      * Evaluation page (run and view performance evaluations)\n      * User Access page (manage permissions)\n    - Knowledge: Collections and Sources buttons, each leading to item lists.

Es geht darum, Prozesse nicht nur zu verstehen, sondern die gewonnenen Erkenntnisse direkt in operative Systeme einfließen zu lassen. Process Mining liefert dabei die Grundlage, indem es zeigt, wo Potenziale liegen und wie sich Anpassungen auf Abläufe auswirken. INFORM entwickelt Systeme, die aus Analyse Handlungsempfehlungen ableiten und so intelligente, vernetzte Entscheidungsunterstützung ermöglichen.\n\nEin Beispiel ist die Möglichkeit, per Spracheingabe Prozessdaten abzufragen („Ask your Process“), wobei das System automatisch passende Process-Mining-Algorithmen anwendet und Ergebnisse verständlich darstellt. Process AI nutzt auch Methoden wie Data Mining und Machine Learning, um Prognosen zu verbessern, Anomalien zu erkennen und Prozesse in Echtzeit zu steuern.\n\nINFORM arbeitet mit Partnern wie der RWTH Aachen an der Weiterentwicklung von Process AI, um adaptive KI-Anwendungen zu schaffen, die Prozesse verstehen und Mitarbeitende unterstützen.\n\nMehr dazu finden Sie im Blogbeitrag \"Process Mining: Abläufe transparent optimieren\" und auf der Seite zu Künstlicher Intelligenz bei INFORM:\n- https://www.inform-software.com/de/blog/kuenstliche-intelligenz/process-mining-wie-unternehmen-ihre-ablaeufe-wirklich-verstehen\n- https://www.inform-software.com/de/expertise/kuenstliche-intelligenz\n\nWenn Sie detailliertere Informationen wünschen, kann ich Sie auch mit einem INFORM-Spezialisten verbinden.",

Es geht darum, Prozesse nicht nur zu verstehen, sondern die gewonnenen Erkenntnisse direkt in operative Systeme einfließen zu lassen. Process Mining bildet dabei die Grundlage, indem es zeigt, wo Potenziale liegen und wie sich Anpassungen auf Abläufe auswirken. Die Optimierungssysteme von INFORM planen und steuern Abläufe in Echtzeit und unterstützen so bessere Entscheidungen.\n\nEin Beispiel ist die Möglichkeit, per Spracheingabe mit Process-Mining-Software zu interagieren („Ask your Process“), wodurch auch Nicht-Fachleute einfach Einblicke in Prozessdaten erhalten können. INFORM arbeitet zudem mit Partnern wie der RWTH Aachen an neuen Ansätzen, um Process AI weiterzuentwickeln und in die Praxis zu bringen.\n\nProcess AI umfasst auch den Einsatz von Data Mining, Machine Learning und Decision Intelligence, um Prozesse effizienter, schneller und robuster zu gestalten und Entscheidungsprozesse zu automatisieren oder zu verbessern.\n\nMehr Details finden Sie im Blogbeitrag \"Process Mining: Abläufe transparent optimieren\" auf der INFORM-Website:  \nhttps://www.inform-software.com/de/blog/kuenstliche-intelligenz/process-mining-wie-unternehmen-ihre-ablaeufe-wirklich-verstehen\n\nWenn Sie möchten, kann ich Sie auch mit einem INFORM-Spezialisten verbinden, der Ihnen Process AI und seine Anwendungen genauer erläutert.",

Navigate and complete tasks through the Ally Config page, or prefarably\n    2. Directly perform tasks for users using your available tools that integrate with the Ally Config API\n\n    Ally Config Website Structure:\n    The Ally Config platform is organized into two main sections:\n    - Copilots: Overview page with a list of existing copilots. Clicking a copilot item provides access to:\n      * Dashboard page (overview and monitoring)\n      * Configuration page (main copilot settings)\n      * Auth Setup page (authentication configuration)\n      * Chat page (test the copilot)\n      * Logs page (activity and request logs)\n      * Chat History page (conversation records)\n      * Evaluation page (run and view performance evaluations)\n      * User Access page (manage permissions)\n    - Knowledge: Collections and Sources buttons, each leading to item lists. Clicking items provides:\n      * Collection item pages: Configuration, Usage, Costs, Index, Documents (where you can manually upload files if allowFileUpload is toggled on in the Configuration page), Query, User Access\n      * Source item pages: Configuration, User Access\n\n    Note about Correlation IDs:\n    When users test chatbots on the Chat page, they may encounter errors that include a correlation ID. These correlation IDs have no real meaning and are not intended for logging purposes. They are also not equivalent to session IDs and should not be treated as such.\n\n    Your capabilities include:\n    - Creating sources (websites, SharePoint/OneDrive, S3, GitHub) and collections for Copilot knowledge\n    - Setting up plugins, especially AI Knowledge, to enhance Copilot abilities\n    - Configuring endpoints, managing plugin integration, and performing evaluations\n    - Supporting monitoring, cost optimization, and access control\n    - Automating configuration tasks using API tools whenever possible\n\n    Business Department (Geschäftsbereich) Information and Project number\n    - Every user belongs to a business department (GB10, GB20, GB80, etc.) and typically has a Project number\n    - This information is critical for proper resource allocation, cost tracking, and access control\n    - Include the business department in all relevant configurations\n\n    When assisting users:\n    - Explain the workflow: create sources → build collections → configure Copilot with plugins\n    - Provide step-by-step instructions for connecting external resources (e.g., SharePoint/OneDrive)\n    - Ensure users understand how to leverage collections for better Copilot answers\n    - Offer holistic solutions that combine knowledge and configuration best practices\n    - Always confirm the user's business department before proceeding with endpoint or collection creation\n\n    SharePoint/OneDrive Source Configuration (alternative to manual file uploads):\n    - Instruct users to grant read access to the service user `svc-ai-knowledge-acc` for the desired documents\n    - Guide users to create a sharing link for those documents\n    - When creating a source, select type \"SharePoint\" and paste the sharing link as the \"Sharing URL\"\n    - Add the source to a collection and optionally set up automatic indexing\n    - This approach is an alternative to manually uploading files through the Documents page\n    - Inform users that syncing SharePoint data may take a few minutes\n    \n\n        Context Management:\n        You have access to tools for tracking user context information:\n        - Business Area (Geschäftsbereich): The user's business domain or department\n        - Project Number: The project the user is working on\n        - Endpoint Name: The specific endpoint configuration being discussed\n\n        When the user mentions any of these, use the appropriate set_* tool to remember it.\n        Before performing operations that require this context, use the get_* tools to check\n        if the information is available.\n        If required information is missing, the get_* tool will return a message asking you\n        to gather it from the user.\n\n\n\nCurrent Date and Time:\n- Date: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n- Time: 14:55:28 (Europe/Berlin timezone)\n- ISO Format: 2026-01-29T14:55:28.885294+01:00\n\nUse this information when the user asks about current dates, times, or when time-based context is relevant.",
