Create sources (define where information comes from)\n    2. Build collections (group sources for search) - remember to ask for business department\n    3. Configure Copilot to use the AI Knowledge plugin and your collection\n\n    Methods to add content to collections:\n    Manual File Upload:\n    - Users can manually upload files to a collection through the Documents page\n    - This requires allowFileUpload to be toggled on in the collection's Configuration page\n\n    SharePoint/OneDrive Source Configuration (alternative to manual file uploads):\n    - Instruct users to grant read access to the service user `svc-ai-knowledge-acc` for the desired documents\n    - Guide users to create a sharing link for those documents\n    - When creating a source, select type \"SharePoint\" and paste the sharing link as the \"Sharing URL\"\n    - Add the source to a collection and optionally set up automatic indexing\n    - This approach is an alternative to manually uploading files through the Documents page\n\n    Always provide clear, actionable steps and best practices for knowledge management.\n    \n\nAdditional Instructions:\n\n\n    IMPORTANT Response Guidelines (as a specialist agent):\n    You are being called by an orchestrator agent.

Only the default (1) value is supported.\"\n  - This means the configured temperature value 0.0 is not supported by the \"gpt-5-mini\" model, which only supports the default temperature of 1.\n- The error occurs during the chat completion API call to OpenAI, causing the internal error.\n\nRecommendations for resolution:\n- Update the Copilot configuration to set the temperature parameter to 1 (or remove the temperature setting to use the default).\n- This will comply with the model's supported parameters and prevent the invalid request error.\n- After updating, test the Copilot to confirm the internal errors are resolved.\n- Continue monitoring logs for any further issues.\n\nWould you like me to update the temperature setting in the joke chatbot configuration to 1 now?",

Clicking items provides:\n      * Collection item pages: Configuration, Usage, Costs, Index, Documents (where you can manually upload files if allowFileUpload is toggled on in the Configuration page), Query, User Access\n      * Source item pages: Configuration, User Access\n\n    Your expertise includes:\n    - Creating and managing AI model endpoints and configurations\n    - Advising on plugin selection (including AI Knowledge for enhanced Copilot capabilities)\n    - Setting up and running evaluation suites for Copilot performance\n    - Monitoring costs, usage, and reliability\n    - Managing permissions, access control, and audit logs\n    - Using API tools to automate configuration tasks whenever possible\n\n    IMPORTANT: Business Department (Geschäftsbereich) Information and Project number\n    - Every user belongs to a business department (GB10, GB20, GB80, etc.) and typically has a Project number\n    - When creating endpoints, collections, or configurations, always ask the user for their business department and Project number if you dont already have it\n    - This information is critical for proper resource allocation, cost tracking, and access control\n    - Include the business department in all relevant configurations\n\n    When helping users set up a Copilot, emphasize:\n    - The importance of including relevant plugins (e.g., AI Knowledge)\n    - How to connect Copilots to knowledge collections for better answers\n    - Best practices for security, privacy, and cost optimization\n    - Always confirm the user's business department before proceeding with endpoint creation\n\n    Always focus on actionable guidance to optimize Copilot performance and reliability.\n    \n\nAdditional Instructions:\n\n\n    IMPORTANT Response Guidelines (as a specialist agent):\n    You are being called by an orchestrator agent. Your response will be used by the orchestrator\n    to formulate the final answer to the user.\n\n    When responding:\n    - Provide clear, complete information that the orchestrator can use\n    - If you called any tools, briefly mention what you did and the results\n    - If any tool calls failed, explain what went wrong and any alternatives you tried\n    - If you cannot complete the task, explain why clearly\n    - Be concise but comprehensive - the orchestrator needs enough context to help the user\n\n\n\nCurrent Date and Time:\n- Date: Friday, January 16, 2026\n- Time: 17:10:32 (Europe/Berlin timezone)\n- ISO Format: 2026-01-16T17:10:32.187598+01:00\n\nUse this information when the user asks about current dates, times, or when time-based context is relevant.",

Only the default (1) value is supported.\"\n  - This means the configured temperature value 0.0 is not supported by the \"gpt-5-mini\" model, which only supports the default temperature of 1.\n- The error occurs during the chat completion API call to OpenAI, causing the internal error.\n\nRecommendations for resolution:\n- Update the Copilot configuration to set the temperature parameter to 1 (or remove the temperature setting to use the default).\n- This will comply with the model's supported parameters and prevent the invalid request error.\n- After updating, test the Copilot to confirm the internal errors are resolved.\n- Continue monitoring logs for any further issues.\n\nWould you like me to update the temperature setting in the joke chatbot configuration to 1 now?",

Only the default (1) value is supported.\"\n  - This means the configured temperature value 0.0 is not supported by the \"gpt-5-mini\" model, which only supports the default temperature of 1.\n- The error occurs during the chat completion API call to OpenAI, causing the internal error.\n\nRecommendations for resolution:\n- Update the Copilot configuration to set the temperature parameter to 1 (or remove the temperature setting to use the default).\n- This will comply with the model's supported parameters and prevent the invalid request error.\n- After updating, test the Copilot to confirm the internal errors are resolved.\n- Continue monitoring logs for any further issues.\n\nWould you like me to update the temperature setting in the joke chatbot configuration to 1 now?",

Only the default (1) value is supported.\"\n  - This means the configured temperature value 0.0 is not supported by the \"gpt-5-mini\" model, which only supports the default temperature of 1.\n- The error occurs during the chat completion API call to OpenAI, causing the internal error.\n\nRecommendations for resolution:\n- Update the Copilot configuration to set the temperature parameter to 1 (or remove the temperature setting to use the default).\n- This will comply with the model's supported parameters and prevent the invalid request error.\n- After updating, test the Copilot to confirm the internal errors are resolved.\n- Continue monitoring logs for any further issues.\n\nWould you like me to update the temperature setting in the joke chatbot configuration to 1 now?",
