Review and tell me if you want any changes — if it looks good I’ll create it.\n\nSuggested values (defaults I recommend)\n- Endpoint identifier: /gb80/icp-docs\n  - (Format must be /SCOPE/NAME; scope = gb80)\n- Display name: ICP Documentation Assistant\n- Description: Assistant that answers questions from the INFORM Cloud Platform (ICP) documentation\n- Project number: (please provide 5 digits)\n- Model (dep_name): gpt-4.1-nano (good balance: low cost, large context)\n- Temperature: 0 (deterministic answers for documentation)\n- Instructions (brief): You are an assistant specialized in the INFORM Cloud Platform (ICP). Use the ICP documentation collection to answer user questions precisely. If the answer is not in the docs, say you don’t know and suggest where to look. Prefer concise, actionable responses and include source links when available.\n- Default greeting message: Hi — I can help with questions about the INFORM Cloud Platform (ICP) documentation. What would you like to know?\n- Initial prompt suggestions (examples):\n  - \"How do I deploy a service on ICP?\"\n  - \"Where are the API reference docs for ICP?\"\n  - \"Show me the ICP authentication flow\"\n- Plugins: AiKnowledge configured to use collection: [\"gb80_icp_docs_collection\"] and host: https://backend-api.dev.ai-knowledge.aws.inform-cloud.io\n  - This connects the Copilot to the collection we created (so it can retrieve documentation).\n- Authorization: use Ally/OpenID default (type \"ally\") so the Copilot uses the portal’s Keycloak for auth. Tell me if you want a public/static token instead.\n\nQuestions for you (short)\n1) Project number (5 digits)?\n2) Do you accept the suggested endpoint /gb80/icp-docs, display name and description, and model gpt-4.1-nano?\n   - If you want a different endpoint name or model, say which.\n3) Confirm authorization: use Ally (recommended) or do you want \"allow\" (no auth) or a static bearer token?\n4) Any other changes to instructions, greeting, temperature?\n\nWhen you confirm and give the project number I will:\n- store the project number,\n- create the Copilot with the settings above,\n- then show you the system response and the new Copilot metadata.",
