(yes/no), any auth (Basic or Bearer) and credentials if needed.\n   - SharePoint/OneDrive: the sharing link (please grant read access for svc-ai-knowledge-acc beforehand — I can’t do that step), optional prefix/suffix filters.\n   - S3: bucket name, access method — role ARN or accessKeyId + secretAccessKey, optional prefix/suffix filters, allowFileUpload? (true/false).\n   - GitHub: organization, repository, branch (default main), personal access token (PAT) if repo is private, optional prefix/suffix filters.\n3. Desired sourceId (must be 8–255 chars; letters, numbers, dash or underscore). If you don’t provide one I’ll suggest a name.\n4. Short description for the source and whether it should be public (true/false).\n5. Do you want me to add this source to an existing collection now? If yes, tell me the collectionId.\n6. Your business department (Geschäftsbereich) and project number — I should save these in context before we proceed.\n\nIf you’re creating a SharePoint source, a reminder of the steps:\n- Grant read access to svc-ai-knowledge-acc for the folder/documents.\n- Create a sharing link and paste it as the sharingUrl when creating the source.\n- After creation, add the source to a collection and trigger indexing (sync can take a few minutes).\n\nGive me the type and the details above and I’ll create the source for you.",
